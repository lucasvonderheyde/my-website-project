                        I have been competing in Super Smash Bros Melee for eight years. What captivates me the most is the game's technical complexity and the challenge it presents, 
                        combined with the opportunity to express my strategies against fellow players. My approach is process-oriented; I dissect the game to uncover its underlying principles, 
                        fundamentals, and heuristics. This not only aids players of all skill levels in deriving enjoyment from the game but also enables me to continually evolve as a player.

                        I'm passionate about traveling. Munich in Germany has a special place in my heart, and I dream of living there one day. In Egypt, I was amazed by the majestic pyramids and indulged 
                        in some truly unforgettable food. Guatemala offered another unique experience; at Lake Atitl√°n, I had the thrill of boating to charming towns and the adrenaline rush of cliff jumping. 
                        I'm eager to revisit these incredible places.

                        One of my cherished pastimes is playing board games with friends and family. I'm particularly drawn to intricate games with inventive systems, where the goal is to achieve the highest score.
                        I love games that not only offer tremendous replay value but also allow for creativity, ensuring a fresh experience with each playthrough. Among my favorites are "War of the Ring" (as pictured), 
                        "Wingspan", "Clank!", and "Scythe".
