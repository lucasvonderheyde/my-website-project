            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                I'm Lucas E. Von der Heyde, a highly motivated individual passionate about technology and software engineering. My educational journey at West Chester University and 
                Duquesne University has equipped me with valuable knowledge. Additionally, coaching at Jefferson University and Level 7 Tennis Academy, 
                along with my experience as a Sales Specialist at REI Coop and Veterinary Technician at Pets First Veterinary Center, has strengthened my skills.

                Excited to attend Flatiron School, I'm eager to fulfill my dream of becoming a skilled software engineer. This opportunity will empower me to embrace new challenges 
                and immerse myself in a dynamic learning environment. I look forward to contributing to the world of technology and creating positive change through innovative solutions.
